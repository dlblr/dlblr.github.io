  Hey there, Neurons! Welcome to the DLBLR group. Check out our upcoming meetings <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Bangalore/">here</a> and join us. 
</p>

The Deep Learning Bangalore group is focuses on bring together people interested in the family of machine learning methods that deals with learning distributed, hierarchical deep representations.   

The format for regular meetups will be based around guest speakers sharing new research ideas and applications covering a wide range of fields from computer vision and natural language processing to autonomous systems and prognostics. A slot for a series of lightning talks will be available for participants to share experiences and insights about deep learning (typically towards the end). We partner in co-organizing Deep Learning summits, workshops, code dojos, and demonstrations.

*Entrepreneurs, developers, students, academicians, investors, and just about anyone* who is interested in Deep Learning is invited. 

This group will serve to be an open platform for people to share *knowledge, practices, research, applications and critiques* of deep learning. We are always on the lookout for interesting speakers and topics. If interested, get in touch.

<!-- In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
