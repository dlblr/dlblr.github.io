title: March Monthly Meetup

The DLBLR January Monthly Meetup saw about 75 Neurons RSVP and was held at BloomReach India. 

  > Title: Tutorial on RNN based sequence models for some natural language processing tasks. <br/>
  > Speaker: Dr. Vikas C. Raykar, Researcher IBM Research, Bangalore 

An expert in machine learning,  Dr Raykar is currently focused on building machines that can understand natural language and images on a par with humans. This session took a deep dive into RNNs as he described their internals and optimization techniques. 

>Title: Deep Learning based Visual Search and Browse for E-Commerce. <br/>
>Speaker: Dr. Krishnendu Chaudhury CTO Staff, Flipkart

Chaudhuryâ€™s talk focused on image search at Flipkart, which uses Triplet Networks instead of Siamese, because triplet pairs (query image, negative image, positive image) are easier to QA and generate. He also talked about old machine learning and its role in deep learning. This was followed by a brief discussion on changing search from plain text to text + images (joint embeddings).
