The DLBLR January Monthly Meetup saw about 77 Neurons RSVP and was held at BloomReach India. 

  > Title: Applying Deep Learning to object recognition and text recognition problems. <br/>
  > Speaker: Dr. Pramod Kompalli, Research Scientist, Xerox Research Center India (XRCI), Bengaluru

Dr Kompalli presented the Xerox teamâ€™s work on applying deep learning to object and text recognition. Deep learning tools, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn representation of visual data. Such representations can solve problems where sufficient data is not available. This has worked significantly well on small data problems arising in Indic text recognition. He concluded with some examples of new problems that can be solved using Deep Neural-Net architectures.

>Title: Applications related to Deep Learning for text. <br/>
>Speaker: Dr. Uma Sawant, Senior Data Scientist, LinkedIn

Dr Sawant talked about deep learning for text,  for example, POS tagging, sentiment analysis and question answering. Sawant briefly described the most successful models applied to text understanding (CNNs and RNNs) ending with an end-to-end example.
