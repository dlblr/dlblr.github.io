title: What's DLBLR?
---

[Deep Learning Bangalore](http://www.meetup.com/Deep-Learning-Bangalore/) was started to bring together anyone how is interested in Deep Learning primarily to share knowledge and experience. As in the case of all recent technologies, community contribution and direction often leads to advances and thereby increasing the adoption of the technology as a tool to solve real world problems.

  > An open people platform unifying entrepreneurs, developers, students, researchers, investors, and just about anyone who is interested in Deep Learning.

The hope is that this platform will serve as an immensely useful forum to collaborate, hack, and contribute towards Deep Learning.
